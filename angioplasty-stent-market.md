<p><h1>Angioplasty Stent Market Size: Growth Outlook from 2025 to 2032, projecting at Market's Trends Analysis by Application, Regional Outlook, and Revenue</h1></p><p><strong>Angioplasty Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>An angioplasty stent is a small, expandable tube used to treat narrowed or blocked arteries, particularly those affected by coronary artery disease. The procedure involves inserting the stent into the affected artery during angioplasty, helping to keep the artery open and ensuring adequate blood flow. This medical device can be made from various materials, including metal and biodegradable substances, and is crucial for preventing restenosis, or re-narrowing of the artery.</p><p>The angioplasty stent market is experiencing significant growth, attributed to the rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and growing awareness about minimally invasive procedures. Technological advancements in stent design, such as the development of drug-eluting stents, which release medication to reduce the risk of re-narrowing, are driving innovation and adoption. </p><p>Additionally, the increasing geriatric population and the corresponding rise in medical procedures have fueled market expansion. The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9% during the forecast period. Ongoing research and development efforts focused on enhancing stent durability and biocompatibility are expected to further influence market dynamics and promote the adoption of advanced angioplasty solutions.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Angioplasty Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Angioplasty Stent Market is segmented into Type I and Type II categories. Type I includes drug-eluting stents (DES), which release medication to prevent restenosis, offering advanced therapeutic benefits. Type II encompasses bare-metal stents (BMS), which provide basic structural support without drug coatings. Both types are used in coronary and peripheral procedures, but DES typically features higher adoption due to their effectiveness in reducing the risk of vessel re-narrowing compared to BMS. The choice depends on patient-specific factors and clinical indications.</p></p>
