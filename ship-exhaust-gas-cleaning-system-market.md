<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Exhaust Gas Cleaning System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ship Exhaust Gas Cleaning System (EGCS) market focuses on three main types: Open Loop Scrubbers, Closed Loop Scrubbers, and Hybrid Scrubbers. Open Loop Scrubbers use seawater to wash exhaust gases, discharging treated water back into the ocean. Closed Loop Scrubbers, conversely, use a recirculated chemical solution, treating and reusing water without releasing it back into the sea. Hybrid Scrubbers can operate in both modes, allowing flexibility depending on regulatory requirements and operational conditions.</p></p>
